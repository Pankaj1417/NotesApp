# NotesApp
This is a android application created using Kotlin and Android Studio
in this application i have implemented Firebase Firestore Database to store the notes of user and user can perform the CRUD operations on database 
all changes will get reflected into the database in realtime.
Also i have implemented Authentication Facility using Firebase Authentication to allow user to create their accounts and save their Notes in their respective accounts.
Anonymous user who doesn't have any account are also allowed to Create notes and whenever they syncs notes they will be able to
create a new account and all those notes created by that user will get stored in FireStore Database.
Anonymous users are maintained using Splash Screen , This user automatically gets created when any unauthenticated user tries to open the application.
